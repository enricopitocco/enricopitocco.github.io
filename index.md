Welcome to my academic portfolio website! I am a PhD student in Brain, Mind and Computer Science at Università degli studi di Padova. My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior, specifically in the field of visual neuroscience and psychophysics.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on low-level visual mechanisms, on the spatio-temporal integration mechanisms of  visual information over time. More specifically, my work explores more in-depth priming-like mechanisms in visual search and serial dependence and aim to test whether these phenomena are different manifestations of a common underlying mechanism.
