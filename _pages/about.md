## Background

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of General Psychology at the University of Padua. My research focuses on visual perception within an interdisciplinary PhD program that integrates cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and computer science to advance the study of the brain–mind system. My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior, specifically in the field of visual neuroscience and psychophysics.

My academic journey includes a Master's degree in Neuroscience and Clinical Neuropsychology from the University of Padova, coupled with a Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Psychology attained at the University of Trento. My professional trajectory has been enriched by significant experiences abroad, including immersive cultural exchanges in the UK (University of Edinburgh), in the Netherlands (Leiden University) and in Portugal (University of Coimbra). 

As a research intern at the University of Coimbra, I focused on neuroimaging techniques with a focus on visual perception. Afterwards, I completed an internship at the Neuropsychiatry Laboratory at Fondazione Santa Lucia, where I contributed to clinical work and research on neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. This experience provided me with clinical diagnostic skills and MRI-based research methods, and was essential for obtaining my psychologist license, which I earned after successfully passing the qualifying exam.

## Research Interests
My current work focuses on low-level vision mechanisms. More specifically, my phd project explores the spatio-temporal integration mechanisms of visual information from past input to current perception.
