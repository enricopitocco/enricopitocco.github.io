This research explores the effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on magnitude processing through both classical and numerical variants of the Delboeuf illusion. The study investigates how this non-invasive brain stimulation technique influences perception and cognitive processing of magnitude information, contributing to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual illusions and numerical cognition.
